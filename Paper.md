# N4meStore-Paper
Delighted to enter and begin our journey within Cardano as the first clothing brand within the ecosystem and one of the first 100% native to the crypto ecosystem. Throughout this paper, we will define what N4ME is and the development of what the evolution of fashion and especially its sale entails, granting true power to the customer.

**What is N4ME?**

N4ME is a clothing brand created by two university students who are passionate about the fashion world and want to definitively expand it into the crypto world, with the intention of giving fashion a new twist.

N4ME is born with the idea of ​​granting more power to the customer and more value to the garments. With the aim of taking the world of fashion to another level, where the user has total freedom to trade with the garment without worrying about its depreciation due to use, before having it physically. Where the garment obtains more intrinsic value in addition to the traditional one by granting advantages and power within the brand.


**Idea**

The idea arises from wanting to create a clothing brand, but being realistic, we knew that it was quite difficult if we didn’t have any differentiating and innovative elements. We started researching what large and emerging brands have as a vital constant and discovered that, as was obvious, the community was the key piece.

However, the community, although cared for by emerging brands, is still treated as customers and is not given the relevance, value, and power within the brand that it should have since it is the one that holds it. Here we found our first differentiating element.

To give that true relevance honestly within the brand, we realized that the safest and most transparent way is through blockchain, as this is the only one that guarantees transparency, speed, and the possibility of community participation in the brand. Our second differentiating element.


**How?**

We have 2 missions: to sell clothing and to involve the community related to the brand within it.

To achieve this, we researched crypto projects that had an active relationship with their community and the methods and protocols they used to achieve it. However, we still had the part of selling the clothes. To do this, we decided to tokenize the garments from each drop, forming NFT collections that contain a unique and limited quantity of garments from that drop.

With the NFTs of the garments related to the drops, the community will be able to participate in the definitive on-chain voting for upcoming drops, garment selections, brand decisions, etc., following a system similar to a DAO.


**The Garment**

After this entire presentation and a brief explanation of how we intend to fulfill our two main missions, the following question arises, and it’s actually the most important one: how does one obtain the physical garment? Well, the procedure is quite similar to that of a conventional online store with the difference of the presence of the NFT. The garment would be configured based on the owner of the NFT who wants the physical garment. The NFT would be sent to a public wallet to be burned, and the physical garment would be delivered to the owner.


**Objectives**

The objectives are different from the 2 missions, but they are related. The dates and a detailed definition of the objectives will be presented in the future roadmap.

N4ME’s objectives would be:

Launch of the 1st drop
Establish a decision-making system within the community
Launch of the 2nd and 3rd drops, as well as the ability to obtain garments in physical format
Expand sections and areas within the brand
Collaborate with other clothing brands or other type of brands
Expand to other networks
The objectives are quite general and are not in order, except for the first three, in order to start defining the brand’s orientation. The objectives and dates will be published with the corresponding roadmap.


**Conclusion**

In this paper, we present our main idea, a concept of how the main functions and objectives of the project and the brand will be. Both the whitepaper, which explains the entire project, as well as the roadmap and the team, will be published later when everything is more complete and defined. With this project, we aim to expand the adoption of cryptocurrencies, innovate in the shopping experience in the fashion world where the customer becomes the true owner and has a defined and important role in the brand.
